### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

- Plugin for OctoPrint if using the Klipper firmware:
    https://github.com/thelastWallE/OctoprintKlipperPlugin/  
    Statistics for OctoKlipper: https://thelastwalle.github.io/plugins-dashboard/
- IoT IndustryAutomation for our whole factory(light, switching remote access to machines, temperatures)  
    For now with LOGO! and Node-Red on Raspberry 4B.  
    Later i want to add some ESP32 for using with different sensors that send  
    over LoRa to a receiver and get the data with MQTT into Node-Red.
